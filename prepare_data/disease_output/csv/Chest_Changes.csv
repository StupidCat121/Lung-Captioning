"Consolidation / ground-glass opacity observed showing patchy, ill-defined opacities scattered throughout both lungs, with a peripheral predominance. Findings are compatible with Inflammatory processes (pneumonia). Some areas show a reverse halo sign. There is also evidence of bronchial dilatation within the affected segments. This pattern is highly suggestive of organizing pneumonia."
"Findings are compatible with Organizing pneumonia, characterized by ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation, with a peripheral and subpleural distribution. These opacities often show areas of architectural distortion and bronchial dilatation. There may be a 'reverse halo' sign. No significant pleural effusion is noted. The imaging features are classic for organizing pneumonia."
"Imaging shows ground-glass opacity corresponding to diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities, predominantly in the right lower lobe; findings are compatible with Atypical/interstitial pneumonia. These opacities are associated with mild interlobular septal thickening. No significant consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. The appearance is suggestive of a viral or atypical infection."
"A well-defined area of ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe is present, findings are compatible with Organizing pneumonia. These opacities have a peripheral distribution. There is also associated architectural distortion. No significant pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy is noted. The pattern is characteristic of organizing pneumonia."
"The pattern of ground-glass opacity aligns with diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities, with a lower lobe predominance. Findings are compatible with Atypical/interstitial pneumonia. These opacities are associated with mild interlobular septal thickening. No significant consolidation or pleural effusion is observed. The findings are most consistent with an atypical pathogen."
"Findings of ground-glass opacity with diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities, predominantly in the mid zones are in keeping with Atypical/interstitial pneumonia. These opacities are associated with mild interlobular septal thickening. No significant consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. Imaging features are in keeping with an atypical or viral pneumonia."
"Appearance demonstrates consolidation, described as ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation, with a peripheral and subpleural distribution; appearance is suggestive of Organizing pneumonia. These opacities often show areas of architectural distortion and bronchial dilatation. There may be a 'reverse halo' sign. No significant pleural effusion is noted. The imaging features are classic for organizing pneumonia."
"Findings are compatible with Inflammatory processes (pneumonia), likely representing Atypical/interstitial pneumonia, supported by diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities, predominantly in the upper zones. These opacities are associated with mild interlobular septal thickening. No significant consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. The overall picture points towards an atypical or viral infection."
"Ground-glass opacity involving diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities, predominantly in the right lower lobe; findings are compatible with an acute Inflammatory processes (pneumonia). These opacities are associated with mild interlobular septal thickening. No significant consolidation or pleural effusion is noted. The findings are characteristic of atypical or interstitial pneumonia."
"Radiographic features of ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation, with a peripheral and subpleural distribution indicate appearance is suggestive of Organizing pneumonia. These opacities often show areas of architectural distortion and bronchial dilatation. There may be a 'reverse halo' sign. No significant pleural effusion is noted. The imaging features are classic for organizing pneumonia."
"Most consistent with Aspiration pneumonia, which commonly involves the dependent lung segments; current imaging shows consolidation as a dense, homogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe, extending to the posterior segment. This opacity obscures the right hemidiaphragm contour. An air bronchogram is present within the consolidated region. The location is highly suggestive of aspiration."
"Consolidation / ground-glass opacity with patchy, ill-defined opacities in the bilateral lower lobes. Appearance is suggestive of Bronchopneumonia (patchy). These opacities are non-segmental and multifocal, with some areas showing a tree-in-bud appearance. No significant volume loss or pleural effusions are identified. The findings are consistent with an acute inflammatory process affecting the small airways."
"Consolidation seen as ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation in the bilateral lower lobes, with areas of architectural distortion. Findings are compatible with Organizing pneumonia. These opacities have a peripheral and subpleural predominance. There are also areas of bronchial wall thickening. No significant pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy is observed. The pattern is characteristic of organizing pneumonia."
