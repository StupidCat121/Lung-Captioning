No pneumothorax is present, with lung markings extending to the chest wall. No acute osseous abnormality of the visualized thorax is noted."
"Within normal limits (WNL) / no acute cardiopulmonary process observed showing costophrenic angles are sharp; no pleural effusion identified. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal size for the lateral view. No pneumothorax is present, with lung markings extending to the chest wall. No acute osseous abnormality of the visualized thorax is noted. Findings are compatible with Normal."
"Findings may reflect no focal consolidation, characterized by costophrenic angles are sharp; no pleural effusion identified. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal size for the PA view. No pneumothorax is present, with lung markings extending to the chest wall. No acute osseous abnormality of the visualized thorax is noted."
"Imaging shows clear lungs corresponding to costophrenic angles are sharp; no pleural effusion identified; most consistent with no acute cardiopulmonary disease. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal size for the AP view. No pneumothorax is present, with lung markings extending to the chest wall. No acute osseous abnormality of the visualized thorax is noted."
"Costophrenic angles are sharp; no pleural effusion identified is present, possibly representing no pleural effusion. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal size for the lateral view. No pneumothorax is seen, with lung markings extending to the chest wall. No acute osseous abnormality of the visualized thorax is present."
"The pattern of no acute cardiopulmonary process aligns with costophrenic angles are sharp; no pleural effusion identified. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal size for the PA view. No pneumothorax is present, with lung markings extending to the chest wall. No acute osseous abnormality of the visualized thorax is noted. Findings are compatible with no acute cardiopulmonary disease."
"Findings of no active pulmonary disease with costophrenic angles are sharp; no pleural effusion identified are in keeping with normal chest radiograph. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal size for the AP view. No pneumothorax is present, with lung markings extending to the chest wall. No acute osseous abnormality of the visualized thorax is noted."
"Appearance demonstrates no acute osseous abnormality, described as costophrenic angles are sharp; no pleural effusion identified; findings are compatible with no acute cardiopulmonary disease. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal size for the lateral view. No pneumothorax is present, with lung markings extending to the chest wall. No acute osseous abnormality of the visualized thorax is noted."
"Findings are compatible with Normal, likely representing no pleural effusion, supported by costophrenic angles are sharp; no pleural effusion identified. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal size for the PA view. No pneumothorax is seen, with lung markings extending to the chest wall. No acute osseous abnormality of the visualized thorax is present."
